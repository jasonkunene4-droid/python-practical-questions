What is the difference between ‘==’ and ‘is’ operator in python?\n","\t== is a comparison operator, it acts as an equality operator comparing the equality in value of two objects.

What are logical operators in python?\n"," \tLogical operators are operators which combine conditional statements, they are primarily to determine if a conditional statement is true or false. These include, ‘and’,‘or’, ‘not’.\n","9. What is type casting in python?\n","    Type casting is the basic concept of changing one data type into another in python, for example when changing an integer into a string and vice versa.\n","10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","\tImplicit type casting is when python automatically performs the conversion of the data type for example adding a float and an integer can automatically give us a float. While explicit type casting requires the programmer to convert the data types manually for example, we cannot add a string and a float unless one is converted to the other, in short, we cannot concatenate theses two which changing them into a singular data type.\n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in python?\n","The purpose of conditional statements in python is to let the program make decisions by executing different code depending on whether the statement condition is true or false\n","\n","12. How does the elif statement work?\n","\tThe Elif statement allows the programmer to add as many required conditional statements, each operating independently or not relying on any previous input, it runs through the choices of conditional statements as inputted by the user. If none of the conditions checked are true then it runs the “else” block of code.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"hyGY5zkRVynx"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"n0RXEfAsLCWL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1757937059422,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":33,"user":{"displayName":"Jason
